# Variance-pretrained-DS
A checkpoint for quick variance diffusion training on DiffSinger 2.0

Supports Japanese, English (Italian and Spanish, non conventional phonetics)

No crediting required if using for pretrained variance, only pitch.

Using the deployed ONNX for a final release is very much not recommended, variance is trained to fit individual voices, but if you decide to for some reason please ask first.
